Logging
-------

The logging cluster provides a simple framework for system instrumentation
and logging.

Usage
-----

A LOGGER can be created that logs to a number of different channels for
particular facilities. A facility can be any named logging service you 
require, such as "system" or "sub-system".

Channels write log messages to an IO_MEDIUM and can be set to filter written
messages based on a maximum and minimum log level.

Two convenience classes provide a standard file logger, STANDARD_LOGGER and 
SHARED_STANDARD_LOGGER. Class SHARED_STANDARD_LOGGER implements a once function
reference to a SHARED_LOGGER instance that can be shared via inheritance.

An example of using the SHARED_STANDARD_LOGGER follows:


	class TEST_LOGGER

	inherit
		SHARED_STANDARD_LOGGER
			export
				{NONE} all
			end
	
	creation
		make

	feature

		make is
				-- Log a few messages
			do
				-- using the convenience routine 'log'
				log (Error, "This is an error")
				log (Critical, "This is a critical error")

				-- using the logger directly with the "general" facility channel
				Logger.channel (Standard_facility).write (Critical, 
					"this is a critical error")
			end

	end
