See below for FastCGI Servlet Library instructions.

Eiffel FastCGI
--------------

The FastCGI library provides a pure Eiffel implementation of the FastCGI
protocol (http://www.fastcgi.com). FastCGI is an extension to the standard
CGI protocol that allows servers to be persistent and provides efficient,
multiplexed communication between a web server and the FastCGI server.

The Eiffel implementation of FastCGI allows you to write FastCGI servers
entirely in Eiffel. The library conforms to the FastCGI specification and
currently has enough functionality implemented to work with the Apache
mod_fastcgi module.

Only FastCGI connections are supported, standard CGI invocation of 
Eiffel FastCGI servers are not supported. Future versions may support this
type of execution.

Usage
-----

The FastCGI protocol is handled by the class GOA_FAST_CGI which provides similar
features to the standard FastCGI API including 'accept' and 'finish'. This
class can be used to perform standard FastCGI operations.

Class GOA_FAST_CGI_APP provides a higher-level abstraction for FastCGI 
applications. This class provides a standard application request processing
loop and a deferred feature 'process_request' that is typically overridden
to perform appropriate request handling.

To use GOA_FAST_CGI_APP, all you need to do is create a decendant class that
implements 'process_request':

------------------------------------------------------------------
class MY_FAST_CGI_APP

inherit
	GOA_FAST_CGI_APP
creation
	make
feature
	process_request is
		do
			putstr ("Content-type: text/html%R%N%R%N")
			putstr ("TESTING<br>%R%N")
		end

end -- class MY_FAST_CGI_APP
-------------------------------------------------------------------

FastCGI Servlets
----------------

The Fast CGI Servlets library implements the Servlet API using FastCGI
as the connection mechanism. This library provides a wrapper on top of 
FastCGI that can be used to build servlet compliant applications.

The library extends GOA_FAST_CGI_APP to provide a GOA_FAST_CGI_SERVLET_APP
that manages the registration of servlets and dispatch of servlet
requests.

See the Servlet API library for more details.

Usage
-----

To build a FastCGI servlet application you need to create a descendant of
GOA_FAST_CGI_SERVLET_APP, register instances of your servlets (descendants of
GOA_HTTP_SERVLET) and call run. For example:

---------------------------------------------------------------------
class MY_FAST_CGI_SERVLET_APP

inherit
	GOA_FAST_CGI_SERVLET_APP
		rename
			make as parent_make
		end
creation
	make
feature
	make is
		local
			config: GOA_SERVLET_CONFIG
			servlet: GOA_HTTP_SERVLET
		do
			parent_make (8000, 5) -- port 8000, 5 backlog requests
			create config
			create {MY_HTTP_SERVLET} servlet.init (config)
			register_servlet (servlet, "test")
			run
		end

end
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

You then need to register the server with Apache using mod_fastcgi. See 
the mod_fastcgi documentation for details. For example, if you register
the server on the localhost with the name 'servlet_app', you can execute
the registered servlet by accessing:

	http://localhost/fcgi-bin/servlet_app/test

in a browser. Additional servlets can be registered by giving a path name
that is mapped to the 'path_info' attribure of the servlet request.
