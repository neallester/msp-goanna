DESCRIPTION

The four files common.xsl, schema_codes.xsl, deferred_xml_writer,
and validating_xml_wrter.xsl are xslt transforms that generate
eiffel classes from a Relax NG grammar.

http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/relax-ng/spec-20011203.html

schema_codes.xsl creates a class that includes integer
codes and string constants representing the elements and attributes
defined in the schema.

deferred_xml_writer.xsl creates a deferred class that represents a
schema fragment intended for inclusion in another schema.  This allows
eiffel to see documents containing the included schema as distinct
types.

common.xsl contains some templates that are common to the various
transforms.

validating_xml_writer.xsl outputs an eiffel class that includes features
for creating and populating an xml document conforming with the
Relax NG schema.  The validity rules defined by the Relax NG grammar
are embedded as preconditions in the eiffel class.

See test/sample.rnc for an example schema that passes all unit tests.

See test/generate_classes.sh for an example of how to use the
transforms on Linux using the Saxon xslt processor (obsolete).

Use the parameters author, copyright, and license to populate the
corresponding indexing clauses in the generated Eiffel classes.




KNOWN LIMITATIONS

1) The Relax NG grammar used as input to the stylesheet may include
   elements from only one namespace, and that namespace must be named
   first in the grammar element.
2) The transforms assume that the xslt processor will return namespace
   prefixes in the order declared in the grammar element (GEXSLT does).
   If the class and feature names don't match the grammar namespace
   prefix, then pass in the prefix as a parameter
   (prefix=namespace-prefix)
3) xsd:nonNegativeInteger is the only data type supported (it should be easy
   to add more).
4) When combining grammars, only the combine="choice" option ( |= in compact
   syntax notation) is supported.  The combine="interleave" option ( &= in
   compact syntax notation) will be interpreted as |=.
   Currently only the combining of lists is supported:
       my_list  = elem1 | elem2
       my_list |= elem3 | elem4
   This is equal to
       my_list = elem1 | elem2 | elem3 | elem4
   The following example will not compile
       my_elem  = element ns:elem1 { ... }
       my_elem |= element ns:elem2 { ... }
5) Does not (currently) support mixing namespaces that contain elements
   with the same name.
6) Lists of aliases are only allowed for elements and not for attributes
7) Dont try to be too smart with your grammar, stuff like (elem1?)+ won't be
   recognised properly. Try to keep your gramar simple, this makes it also easier
   to understand.
