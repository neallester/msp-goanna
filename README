Project Goanna
--------------

Welcome to Project Goanna. This project aims to provide a framework and
set of tools for building dynamic internet applications using the Eiffel
language. You will find documentation for installing and using the Goanna
libraries and tools in the 'doc' directory.

I hope you find Project Goanna useful and also hope you can contribute to
its development.

All documentation is in HTML format and can be found in the 'doc' directory.
